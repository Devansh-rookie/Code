// when performing b= ++a or b= a++

// right shift operator means to divide by a>>n,a/2^n
// left shift operator means to multiply by a^n when
//a<<n, a*2^n


// sizeof operator
//ternary operator (condn?A:B); if true then A else B
//cast operator changes from one datatype to another

//char ch='a';
//int(ch) would give 97 that is the ASCII code of a;

// comma operator
//a=(2,3,4), 4 would be assigned to a las value or operation is
//assigned

// & --> address of the variable
// * --> pointer to a variable
